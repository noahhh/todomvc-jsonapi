## Goal

Your goal is to make a controller (Api::V1::TodosController) for the Backbone-powered TodoMVC app to interact with. You will have to make your JSON output [JSON-API](http://jsonapi.org/) compliant.

You have to use one of the following methods to create your JSON:

* [ActiveModelSerializers](http://www.rubydoc.info/gems/active_model_serializers/0.8.2)
* [JBuilder](https://github.com/rails/jbuilder)
